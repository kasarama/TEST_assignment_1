## 1. REFLECTIONS

### 1. SHOOTING

    A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying.

- Cartridges were blank
- She missed
- Wound wasn't fatal
- Man got medical help quickly enough
- Man was wearing a bulletproof vest
- Gun was not charged
- Gun was malfunctioned
- Gun was not a real gun
- There was an obstacle between men and woman
- Man was immortal
- She shot at the wrong man

### 2. ALIEN

    An alien meets you, and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)

1. In order to be able to brush your teeth you need to use a toothpaste, a toothbrush and water.
2. Decide which of your hands is more comfortable to hold and operate (small but precise movements) with a toothbrush.
   We will refer to this hand as a B-hand
3. Grab a toothpaste tube with the other hand in a way that your thumb is pointing towards the tube cap and then without
   changing the position of the tub in your hand, secure the tube, so it isn’t falling out of your hand and at the same
   time it isn’t changing it’s form by squeezing it.
4. Open the tube with B-hand, by turning it’s cap anti-clockwise.
5. Grab a toothbrush with your B-hand in a way that your thumb is pointing towards the head of the toothbrush.
6. Direct the tube towards the brush head, and begin to gently squeeze the tube, so the toothpaste is coming out of the
   tube and stays on the toothbrush head. Stop if there is 0,25 cl of the paste on the brush.
7. Put the tube to the side and adjust the grip on the brush so the brush will not fall off from your hand when you
   start to operate with it.
8. Open your mouth and start saying “e” for 2 seconds. That is to find the start position of your jaws. Start brushing
   your teeth with circular moves around the front side of your teeth (the outer surfaces) and let the past spread on
   the teeth. Put a bit of pressure on your teeth with the brush in order to reach the interdental spaces but do not
   press hard enough to hurt your gums.
9. Keep brushing for 30 seconds
10. Now say “a” for 2 seconds to find the next position of your jaws for brushing.
11. Brush the top of the crowns of your teeth (the chewing surfaces) with cirkular moves in both upper and lower jaw as
    you did before.
12. Use 30 seconds on each jaw.
13. Now clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth, by tilting the brush vertically and make several up-and-down
    strokes (use 10 seconds on that).
14. Then clean the inside surfaces of the side teeth with a tilted brush like in the previous step and make several
    side-to-side strokes (use 20 seconds on that).
15. Rinse off any paste residue with water.

## THOUGHTS ON BDD

- What was positive and good about using BDD?
    - Tests are translated directly from english to code. In this way, the testing feature is understable for any other
      than developer 
- What was annoying or difficult?
  - additional files must be created and a lot of text must be written.
- What surprised you?
    - The possibility of writing more complex test with tabular data and scenario outlines.
- Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more?
    - Describing the test suite determined tested features. That means the code was developed according to described
      criteria to implement required functionalities and only those.
- Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?
    - Not in these two particular tasks
